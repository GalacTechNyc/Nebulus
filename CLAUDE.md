# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Nebulus** is an AI-powered web browser project that aims to enhance the browsing experience through intelligent features like content understanding, smart navigation, and automated interactions.

## Collaboration Context

This project involves collaboration between Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. See `CODEX_INTRO.md` for the introduction message to Codex outlining the project vision and collaboration approach.

## Planned Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript for UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js/Python for AI processing services  
- **Browser Engine**: Electron or Tauri for cross-platform desktop app
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI APIs, local models, or hybrid approaches
- **Storage**: Local databases for user preferences and cache

## Development Focus Areas

1. **Architecture Design** - Modular, scalable browser component systems
2. **AI Integration** - Smart features like content summarization and predictive navigation
3. **Performance** - Fast, responsive browser despite AI processing overhead
4. **Security & Privacy** - Robust handling of user data and AI processing
5. **Code Quality** - Clean, maintainable code with comprehensive testing

## Development Setup

Project structure and build tools are not yet established. As development progresses, this section will include:

- Build and development commands
- Testing frameworks and commands
- Linting and formatting tools
- Local development setup instructions

## Architecture

High-level architecture will be documented here as the system design evolves, including:

- Browser engine integration patterns
- AI service communication flows
- Data storage and privacy models
- Component interaction patterns
