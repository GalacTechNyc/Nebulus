# Hello Codex! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ”¥

Welcome to **GalactusIDE** - we're about to build something that could literally reshape how developers work!

## ðŸŒŒ The Vision
We're not just building a browserâ€”we're creating the **ultimate AI-powered development command center**. Think VS Code + Chrome DevTools + AI Assistant + One-Click Deploy, all unified into a single, god-tier development experience.

**Core Concept**: "Design. Code. Debug. Deploy. All without leaving the tab."

## ðŸš€ What We're Building
**GalactusIDE** combines:
- **AI Vision System**: Screen-aware AI that can see, click, and interact with any webpage
- **Built-in Web IDE**: Monaco editor with real-time preview and full-stack support
- **One-Tap Deployment**: Instant deploy to Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare with auto-config
- **AI Dev Agent**: Your entire dev team in a sidebar panel
- **Modular UI**: Customizable panels for your perfect workflow

## ðŸ§  How I'd Like You to Assist
This is **next-level collaboration**. I need you to help me:

1. **MVP Architecture** - Design the Electron shell with embedded Chromium + Monaco
2. **AI Integration Layer** - Build the screen capture, analysis, and interaction systems  
3. **Deployment Engine** - Create seamless CI/CD with major platforms
4. **Code Generation** - Implement context-aware AI that can write full applications
5. **Performance Magic** - Keep everything lightning-fast despite the AI processing

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack (Locked & Loaded)
- **Shell**: Electron (cross-platform power)
- **Browser**: Chromium (embedded engine)
- **Editor**: Monaco (VS Code core)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **AI**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini APIs
- **Execution**: WebAssembly + Docker sandboxing
- **Deploy**: Vercel CLI, Netlify API, Cloudflare Pages

## ðŸŽ¯ Let's Start Cooking
Check out `GALACTUS_VISION.md` for the complete feature roadmap and architecture details.

**First Mission**: Let's build the MVP foundationâ€”Electron shell with Monaco editor and basic AI integration.

This could be the development tool that makes everything else obsolete. Ready to build the future? âš¡ðŸ”¥
