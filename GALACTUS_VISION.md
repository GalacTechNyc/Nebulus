- **Interactive AI**: can click, type, and manipulate page elements
- **Voice commands**: "Fix this error", "Deploy this site", "Optimize this component"

### 2. 💻 Built-In Web IDE
- **Monaco Editor** (VS Code core) with full syntax highlighting
- **Real-time preview pane** for HTML/CSS/JS changes
- **Full-stack templates**: React, Next.js, Node.js, Flask, Vue, etc.
- **AI code generation** with full project context understanding

### 3. 🚀 One-Tap Deploy System
- **Instant deployment** to Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages
- **Auto-configuration**: handles .vercel.json, package.json, routing
- **Asset management**: direct upload from editor to CDN
- **Environment management**: dev, staging, production with one click

### 4. 🤖 AI Dev Agent Sidebar
Your entire dev team in one panel:
- **"Build me a sneaker store landing page"**
- **"Turn this Figma screenshot into React components"**
- **"Scan for security vulnerabilities"**
- **"Optimize this for mobile"**
- **Git integration**: auto-commit summaries and branch management

### 5. 🎛️ Modular Panel System
- **Resizable panels**: Browser, Editor, Terminal, AI, Console, DevTools
- **Customizable layouts**: save your perfect development environment
- **Dark mode only** (obviously)
- **Command palette**: ⌘+K for instant access to any function
