# Project Analysis

*This file was generated by Codex to summarize the current state of the project and outline findings and recommendations.*

## Overview
GalactusIDE is an AI-powered development browser that integrates a full-featured code editor, embedded Chromium webview, integrated terminal, and AI services for code generation, debugging assistance, and one-click deployment.

## Documentation
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive vision and roadmap files: `CODEX_INTRO.md`, `GALACTUS_VISION.md`, `MVP_ROADMAP.md`, `TESTING_PLAN.md`.
- Detailed collaboration history in `COLLABORATION_LOG.md`.

**Gaps & Inconsistencies:**
- Missing `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, and GitHub Actions workflows despite references in `README.md`.
- Outdated or inconsistent docs (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` still references "Nebulus" and Tauri, while the project is now "GalactusIDE" using Electron).
- Conflicting project naming: package.json homepage references `nebulus` but README and code refer to `GalactusIDE`.

## Tech Stack
- **Shell**: Electron
- **Editor**: Monaco (VS Code core)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + styled-components
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Terminal**: xterm.js + node-pty
- **AI**: OpenAI API (GPT-4), Claude, Gemini
- **Bundler**: Webpack

## Testing
- Jest is configured (`jest.config.js`, `jest.setup.js`) with one existing test suite under `src/renderer/services/ipc.test.ts`.
- Legacy test prototypes and HTML artifacts exist at the project root (`*.html`, `test-*.js`, `test.py`) but are not integrated into the current test suite.
- No CI pipeline or automated end-to-end tests are defined.

## Build & CI/CD
- Build scripts cover development, production builds, packaging, linting, and type-checking.
- No pre-commit configuration is present; code style and commit checks are not enforced automatically.
- README refers to GitHub Actions and deployment workflows but no `.github/workflows` folder exists.

## Findings & Recommendations
1. **Documentation housekeeping**: Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE` file; remove or update outdated docs (`CLAUDE.md`); align project naming.
2. **Testing**: Consolidate or remove legacy test files; expand unit and integration tests to cover core services and components; implement E2E tests via Playwright or Spectron.
3. **CI/CD**: Introduce GitHub Actions workflows for type-check, lint, tests, builds, and packaging.
4. **Code Quality**: Add a pre-commit config to enforce linting and formatting on changed files.
5. **Release automation**: Consider tagging and versioning strategies, automated releases via GitHub Actions.
