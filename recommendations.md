# Recommendations

## Gemini's Recommendations

### 1. Clean Up Old, Duplicate, and Ambiguously Named Files

**Finding:** The project contains several files that appear to be backups, duplicates, or temporary test files. This adds clutter to the codebase, makes it harder for new developers to navigate, and increases the risk of accidentally importing or using outdated code.

*   **Backup Files:** Files like `CustomizableLayout.tsx.bak`, `ProfessionalIDE.tsx.bak`, and `index.html.bak` are likely outdated backups and should be removed. Version control (Git) should be the single source of truth for file history.
*   **Ambiguous Files:** Files such as `new-file-*.js`, `test.py`, `goo.py`, `goog.py`, and `google.py` in `src/renderer/components` have non-descriptive names. Their purpose is unclear, and they should be either renamed to reflect their function or deleted if they are no longer needed.
*   **Root Directory Clutter:** The root directory contains several HTML files (`debug-test.html`, `simple-test.html`, etc.) that seem to be for isolated testing or debugging. These should be moved to a dedicated `sandboxes` or `tests/manual` directory to keep the project root clean and focused on the core application.

**Recommendation:** Perform a thorough audit of the project to identify and remove these files. Standardize on a clear naming convention for all new files.

### 2. Consolidate Redundant Components

**Finding:** There are multiple components with the same name in different locations, which can lead to significant maintenance issues and bugs.

*   **`SimpleEditor.tsx`:** This component exists in both `src/renderer/components/` and `src/renderer/components/Editor/`. This duplication means a bug fix or feature addition in one might be missed in the other.
*   **`App.tsx`:** This component is present in both `src/renderer/` and `src/renderer/components/`. This is highly confusing. The root `App.tsx` is likely the main application entry point, making the one in `components` a likely candidate for removal.

**Recommendation:** For each case of duplication, determine which component is the correct one, make it the single source of truth, and update all import paths to point to it. Then, delete the redundant file.

### 3. Standardize Component and Directory Structure

**Finding:** The project's component structure is inconsistent. Some components reside in their own dedicated directories (e.g., `Browser/Browser.tsx`), while others are placed directly in the parent `components` directory (e.g., `MonacoEditor.tsx`).

**Recommendation:** Adopt and enforce a consistent directory structure for all components. A common and effective pattern is to create a directory for each component that contains the component's logic (`index.tsx` or `ComponentName.tsx`), its styles, and any related files like tests. This improves organization, makes components more self-contained, and simplifies navigation.

**Example:**
```
- /components
  - /MonacoEditor
    - MonacoEditor.tsx
    - MonacoEditor.styles.ts
    - index.ts
```

### 4. Implement Code Splitting for Better Performance

**Finding:** The application is an IDE, which can grow to be quite large. The current Webpack configuration appears to bundle the entire renderer application into a single file, which can lead to slow initial load times as more features are added.

**Recommendation:** Use Webpack's code splitting capabilities with dynamic `import()`. This will allow you to load features or heavy components on-demand. For example, complex language-specific features for the Monaco editor, or less-frequently used panels, could be loaded only when the user accesses them, significantly improving the application's startup performance.

### 5. Enhance Test Coverage

**Finding:** The project has a testing framework (Jest) set up, but there is only one test file (`ipc.test.ts`). This level of test coverage is insufficient for an application of this complexity and leaves it vulnerable to regressions.

**Recommendation:** Increase test coverage significantly.
*   **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests for critical components and utility functions, especially those with complex logic like the `AIAssistant`, `FileExplorer`, and the `useAppState` hook.
*   **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests for key user workflows, such as opening and editing a file, running a command in the terminal, or interacting with the AI assistant. This will ensure that different parts of the application work together as expected and will make future refactoring much safer.

## Codex's Recommendations

1. **Documentation housekeeping**: Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `LICENSE` file; update outdated documentation but preserve `CLAUDE.md` (required for Claude Code guidance); align project naming.
2. **Testing**: Consolidate or remove legacy test files; expand unit and integration tests to cover core services and components; implement E2E tests via Playwright or Spectron.
3. **CI/CD**: Introduce GitHub Actions workflows for type-check, lint, tests, builds, and packaging.
4. **Code Quality**: Add a pre-commit config to enforce linting and formatting on changed files.
5. **Release automation**: Consider tagging and versioning strategies, automated releases via GitHub Actions.
